# Student Manager


This is a portion of code for an ongoing project for a Sports Camp. They asked me to develop a system where they could maintain their students, employees and schedule. Students purchase a numbered pack of classes which they can use during the month. In case of an emergency, bad weather conditions, or if a student cancels ahead of time they have the right to have a make-up class. This brings a burden on the insturctors when they have to organize each individual student and rely on a spreadsheet. This part of the code is more focused on the backend portion of the project. We are testing all FastAPI endpoints currently and SQL Databases.
